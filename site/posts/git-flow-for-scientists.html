  <!-- bootstrap works by allowing you to define different behaviors for
       different size screens. Classes with the -xs, -sm, -md, or -lg extensions
       are defined to behave differently on different size screens. Here, the
       navbar-expand-md tag means that on medium size screens, the nav bar will
       have all the buttons visible, but on small and extra-small screens (mainly)
       phones and tablets) will require a button press to bring up the nav bar buttons -->

        <p>After using Git for version control throughout my Ph.D., I've become a big proponent
        of using the <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git flow</a>
        model. It was a very good fit for my research, because I was working on a satellite product
        that we work periodically release new versions of to the public - so the Git flow paradigm
        of having a stable master branch and an unstable develop branch made a lot of sense. But,
        even if you just have a code base that's shared among your lab mates, or even just your
        own code, it's a good model to follow.</p>

        <p>Where things get a little tricky is that, in many ways, a Ph.D. can be considered one
        <i>really</i> long development time feature branch. So it's somewhat inevitable that you'll
        run into a situation where you've been happily working away on a branch that probably won't
        be ready to merge back into develop for another six months. Let's say that this is code to
        process raw data from an instrument in your lab into calibrated, useful data, and you're working
        on a major overhaul to deal with much higher time resolution data from your experiment.</p>

        <p>Then another lab member tells you about a problem they're having: if the data is taken over
        two days (crosses midnight) the current processing code can't process that as a single run. Fortunately,
        this is something you already fixed in your rewrite! Unfortunately its stuck as part of this big,
        long-term branch. You're quite confident that the fix for data crossing midnight works as intended,
        but you're no where near ready to merge the whole branch into develop. How can you merge just the fix
        into develop?</p>
