        <p><a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> is a relatively new programming language, with it's 1.0 release just a few years ago in 2018.
        It's geared towards the same sort of technical computing problems that Python, R, and Matlab have targeted for years with one key 
        difference: Julia aims to be easy to use like them but also fast. In my field I've been seeing people try to apply Julia to computationally
        intensive problems like climate modeling, radiative transfer, or remote sensing retrievals that have been traditionally written in 
        Fortran or another ahead-of-time compiled language because the application needs the computational speed that Fortran gives compared to
        Python, R, et al.</p>

        <p>This is what I've heard Julia developers and advocates call the "two language problem": subject matter experts (scientists, engineers, etc.)
        are more comfortable writing in a flexible lanuage like Python so they code up the algorithm that needs to be run in that language, but then
        when it comes time to put it into production it needs translated to something faster like Fortran by a software expert. Now the subject 
        expert can't as easily modify the production code if they need to adjust the algorithm.  In theory, Julia solves that problem by having a
        simple syntax and fast execution.</p>

        <p>So, is Fortran dead and Julia the new queen? Surprisingly, I'm going to argue <b>no</b>, but not because Julia doesn't deliver on what it
        promises for speed, but because to achieve flexibility it had to give up on safety.</p>

        <p>Let's get this out of the way now: Julia is certainly fast, but well written Python (for example) can be too.
          I did a little timing test, where I compared multiplying two arrays with 100 million elements in Julia, Python,
          and C++. All three test files are <a href="https://gist.github.com/joshua-laughner/d2207b5084e224e634d8a091101e9e23">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>For the C++ code, I timed allocating the output array and actually multiplying separately. Allocation on my computer took
        3 &mu;s, while the multiplications took between 262 and 359 ms each.</p>

        <p>In the Python test, I did the multiplication as a list comprehension, a <code>for</code> loop (saving entries into a 
          preexisting list), and Numpy array multiplication. The first two methods took <i>forever</i>: between 6.9 and 10.9 s for 
          the first and 10.2 s and 13.6 s for the second - and that's excluding the time to initialize the destination list. 
          But using Numpy arrays - like you would normally for this kind of work - took only 163 to 192 <b>ms</b>, 
          <i>faster</i> than my C++.</p>

        <p>Finally I tested this in Julia. I tried a few different ways - using broadcasting (like you would with Numpy) and using a <code>for</code> loop, as well as preallocating
          or not. Preallocating always reported about 200 ms faster than not, so I assume the allocation takes about that long. Much slower
          than C++, but Julia array are also more than just a pointer to a block of memory. Critically, the actual multiplication took 
          around 500 ms. This is slower than Numpy, <i>but didn't matter whether I used a <code>for</code> loop or not.</i>
        </p>

        <p>So is Julia fast? The numbers seem to say not as fast as Numpy, but:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I have not used Julia nearly as long as I've used Python, so I could be missing an obvious optimization</li>
          <li>Critically, using a <code>for</code> loop is just as fast as the matrix element-wise multiplication</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This is one very nice thing about Julia: it is "fast by default". If it make sense to write your code using a 
          <code>for</code> loop, do it. If doing element-wise multiplication is clearer, do that. It's quite liberating
          to not have to always be thinking "how do I make this an element-wise operation".

        <p>Speed is, honestly, not the only reason to choose a language like C++ or Fortran. Another big reason is that they
          are statically typed, which eliminates a whole category of bugs. So, while in Python, you could write a function 
          like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
def calc_potential_temperature(t, p):
    return t * (1000/p)**0.286
        </pre>

        <p>and as long as the values you pass in for <code>t</code> and <code>p</code> can be multiplied and raised to a power,
        this will work. That's convenient because now you can use it for scalars, Numpy arrays, Pandas dataframes, xarray data arrays,
        and all compatible combinations of those.</p>

        <p>As handy as this is when you're doing a quick analysis, it starts to lose its charm as you build bigger programs in Python.
          Now, you're calling this function at the bottom of a 10-deep call stack, and you're not actually sure what types <code>t</code>
          and <code>p</code> are. You assume that they're Numpy arrays because you've tried to keep all your variables as arrays, but 
          you can't be sure. You test it as best you can though, so it's time to go ahead and run this program on the cluster.
        </p>

        <p>Then you get the dreaded JOB FAILED email... the error message says something about xarray coordinates, but points to this 
          function. Why is it getting xarray arrays and not Numpy arrays? Oh right, you'd decided to load the bigger datasets on the 
          cluster with xarray to take advantage of lazy loading... and never converted them to standard numpy arrays.
        </p>

        <p>This is the downfall of dynamic typing; it's convenient, but then you have to anticipate all possible input types, or 
          check for types manually (and take some performance hit), or grit your teeth and deal with the type bugs as they crawl out.
          In contrast, a statically typed language would let you declare these inputs must be Numpy arrays, and then the compiler will 
          verify that every possible code path leads to these being Numpy arrays. No surprises, no unexpected type bugs, but at the 
          cost of flexibility.
        </p>

        <p>As you work on bigger and bigger projects, this trade off of flexibility in exchange for automatic and thorough type checking
          becomes more and more worth it. Being able to know, without a doubt, that your inputs will be a specific type, makes it much 
          simpler to write a small part of a larger program, or edit it with confidence.
        </p>

        <p>Here's where some confusion about Julia creeps in: it <i>looks</i> like it does this. You can define, for example:</p>

        <pre>
function calc_potential_temperature(t::Array{Float64,1}, p::Array{Float64,1})
    return t .* (1000 ./ p) .^ 0.286
end
        </pre>

        <p>and indeed, this will only ever be called with 1D arrays of floats. But there's a crucial difference between this and 
          a true statically typed language: <i>when</i> this is checked. For C, C++, Fortran or their ilk, this happens at compile 
          time. In Julia, this still happens at run time. What's the difference? Well, let's take the example above where we tested 
          our Python code on our computer without a problem, but it crashed on the cluster. To make this a little more concrete, 
          take this psuedocode as the key part of the program:
        </p>

        <pre>
if file_size > 2GB:
    atmos_pres = lazy_load(data_file, 'pressure')
    atmos_temp = lazy_load(data_file, 'temperature')
else:
    atmos_pres = load_now(data_file, 'pressure')
    atmos_temp = load_now(data_file, 'temperature')

atmos_pt = calc_potential_temperature(atmos_temp, atmos_pres)
        </pre>

        <p>If it were written in, say C++, then when you compiled in on your computed to test, the compiler could tell if
          <code>lazy_load</code> and <code>load_now</code> returned different types, and error immediately if one of those types 
          didn't match the input types to <code>calc_potential_temperature</code>. (Technically it would error earlier, but let's 
          keep it simple.)
        </p>

        <p>Julia doesn't check that. What it does it when it compiles it says to itself "Okay, here I will need to call something 
          named <code>calc_potential_temperature</code>. Let's see what types <code>atmos_temp</code> and <code>atmos_pres</code>
          are when this actually runs, and we'll figure out which version of <code>calc_potential_temperature</code> to call then."
          You run it on your computer, it gets to the call to <code>calc_potential_temperature</code>, and because your computer 
          uses <code>load_now</code>, <code>atmos_temp</code> and <code>atmos_pres</code> are simple arrays. Julia goes "Yup, I 
          have a version of <code>calc_potential_temperature</code> that takes two arrays of floats - use that one!". Then you move 
          to the cluster, where <code>atmos_temp</code> and <code>atmos_pres</code> are something else. Julia doesn't worry about 
          that until it reaches that line during execution, and <i>then</i> says "Oh, hmmm, nope. No version of <code>calc_potential_temperature</code>
          that takes two lazy arrays. Sorry - MethodError!" In other words, while Julia's typing can ensure you don't get an unexpected
          type inside the function, it can't guarantee that the function is never called with the wrong type.
