  <!-- bootstrap works by allowing you to define different behaviors for
       different size screens. Classes with the -xs, -sm, -md, or -lg extensions
       are defined to behave differently on different size screens. Here, the
       navbar-expand-md tag means that on medium size screens, the nav bar will
       have all the buttons visible, but on small and extra-small screens (mainly)
       phones and tablets) will require a button press to bring up the nav bar buttons -->

        <p>In my Ph.D. work, I did a lot of work with a <a href="https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/2069/2018/">decently large
          algorithm to interpret satellite data</a>. By the time I finished, it was split into six different Git repos. There were:</p>

        <ul>
          <li> the core code</li>
          <li> utilities functions closely related to the core code, but used by other projects</li>
          <li> general utility functions I used in all my projects</li>
          <li> utilities for working with model data needed as input to the algorithm, and</li>
          <li> two specialized repos that addressed very specific requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So it made a lot of sense to break it up like this - it helped keep the code organized, and meant that if I wanted to share
        say, just the general utilities with someone else, I could give them just the general utilities repo and not the whole algorithm.</p>

        <p>Of course, this did cause another issue, namely it became a bit of a chore to have multiple branches for this project, since I would
        have to create that same branch in every repo, and switch back and forth between branches in all six repos. I'm a big proponent of the
        <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git flow workflow</a>, so I would (a) need to switch all those branches
        for every branch to develop a new feature, and (b) would have to make sure to merge all six develop branches into master when it came time
        to release a new version of the satellite data generated by this algorithm. Sometimes I could get away only having a separate branch in one
        or two of the repos, but that assumed that I either knew I'd only have to make changes in those repos, or could count on myself to remember
        that I hadn't branched some of the repos.</p>

        <p>While I was in the process of splitting up the code into these six repos, I did try to come up with a better way to do it. The problem was
        that I didn't just want to tie these six repos together in some way - that would have been easy. I also wanted to be able to have separate
        versions of these repos for different projects.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>I wanted a way </b></li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <li><b><i>Easy for another scientist to obtain.</i></b> This means a single repo that can just be cloned or downloaded.</li>
          <li><b><i>Permits reuse of custom utility repos and allows them to be at different versions for different projects.</i></b></li>
          <li><b><i>Easy to modify those utility repos and have the changes take effect immediately.</i></b> Basically, we don't want to
            have to do an extra step beyond just editing the utility to make other modules use that change.</li>
          <li><b><i>Can push/pull changes to and from those utility repos.</i></b></li>
          <li><b><i>All repos are part of the same history.</i></b> That is, if you have a few different branches for your project,
            or if you want to go back to an old commit, you don't want to have to remember to do that in multiple repos.</li>
          <li><b><i>Compatible with Jupyter notebooks.</i></b></li>
        </ol>
