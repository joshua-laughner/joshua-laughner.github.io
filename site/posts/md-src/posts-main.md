Anyone who knows me finds out rather quickly that I have many opinions on
programming and data science, and especially about how to do them well and
avoid common pitfalls. If that sounds interesting to you, please check out
the links either in the menu to the right (on large screen devices) or in
the collapsible cell at the top of this page (under the main menu bar, on
smaller devices).

I'll try to adhere to the following conventions throughout:

* Monospaced text in `this style`, inline with regular text, is either a terminal/shell
  command, a snippet of code, or a filename.
* Monospaced text in a grey block is either an extended code segment, an example of input
  and output in a terminal/shell, or the contents of a file. [An example is](https://xkcd.com/221/):

```
def random_i_promise():
    return 42  # chosen at random, I swear
```

* In these blocks, when I am giving an example of shell I/O, lines that start with a `$` are
  inputs - you would type everything after the dollar sign. Other lines are what is returned
  by the program. In the example, you would type `git --version` and see the second line:

```
$ git --version
git version 2.28.0
```

* If I have something to say as an aside that's noteworthy but not crucial to the main point
  of the post, it will be in a blue bubble like this:

<div class="aside">
This is interesting, but not critical.
