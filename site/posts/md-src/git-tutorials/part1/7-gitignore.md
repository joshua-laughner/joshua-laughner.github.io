# Part 1, Lesson 7: Ignoring files 

## Conclusion

That brings us to the end of Part I! That should cover all the commands you need to use Git to keep track
of how your code, Latex file, or other text document evolves over time. In Part II, we'll move on to 
branches, which allow you to have multiple versions evolving in parallel. 

Before you start on Part II, I recommend you take some time to get comfortable with the skills covered
in this part. Don't feel like you should have mastered everything just by reading this tutorial - like
any other skill, using Git takes practice to become fluent with. 

What I usually recommend is that you pick one project or part of a project that you think would benefit
from version control, start tracking it, and set aside time at the end of each time you work on it to make
a new commit. Then, as you continue to work on it and try to use the tools we covered to review your history,
you should start to see times when you wish you had an extra commit or two in there, or times when several
commits could really have been one without losing any important history. When you're ready, move on to Part II.
