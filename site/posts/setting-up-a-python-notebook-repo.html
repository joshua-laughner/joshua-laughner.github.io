            After working in computationally-driven science for 7 years and using Python Jupyter notebooks for almost 2, 
            here's an organizational structure that I've found works quite well for me.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Create a conda environment for this project and install a notebook kernel for it</li>
              <li>Create a Git repo for the notebooks and code</li>
              <li>Notebooks (named by date) in the top directory, then make subdirectories for data, images, and external code</li>
              <li>Have one Python package ("nbcode" for example) for reused code in this project</li>
              <li>Add other custom Python packages as submodules (or <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo">subrepos</a>)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          I've found this organization helps me isolate code to a single project, but still allow sharing code between different projects
          when ready, keep data files with their associated notebook, and find and reuse old work reasonably easily. Let me walk you through
          each of the steps and I'll describe the reasoning behind each one.

        <h3>Step 1: Creating a Conda environment and linking to your notebooks</h3>
      
        <p>The first step is always to create a virtual environment for whatever project you're working on. <i>Project</i> in this case 
        could mean an analysis leading towards a paper, regular raw data processing for upload to collaborators, anything like that. I 
        use <code>conda</code> to manage environments nowadays rather than the <code>venv</code> module. Because conda can install non-Python 
        libraries, I find it a lot more flexible.</p>

        <p>Assuming you have <code>conda</code> installed, all you have to do to create an environment is:</p>
        
        <pre>
conda create -n [environment name] -c conda-forge python=3
        </pre>

        <p>for example,</p>

        <pre>
conda create -n air-quality -c conda-forge python=3
        </pre>

        <p>will create an environment named "air-quality" and install Python 3 into it. (<code>python=3</code> means install the "python" package 
        that is some 3.y.z version.) The <code>-c conda-forge</code> bit is optional; it means to use the "conda-forge" channel as the top priority 
        rather than the default channel. "Channels" are basically sites that conda can download packages from. "conda-forge" is more open than the 
        default channel, so in my experience a lot of custom geoscience packages are available through "conda-forge" that aren't in the default 
        channel. You <i>could</i> skip this and start with the default channel, but in my experience it's a little bit more stable to install as 
        many packages as possible from one channel, rather than a mix of conda-forge and default, so I like to start from conda-forge.</p>

        <p>Now, creating an environment doesn't automatically make it available to notebooks. To do that, we need to install an IPython kernel that
        connects the notebook server to the Python environment. There's a few solutions, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38880722">this one</a>
        in theory will automatically make all of your environments available automatically. I've not had luck with that in the past, and in any case 
        will create environments that will never get used by notebooks, so I use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53546675">a different answer 
        from the same thread</a>. Assuming we want to make our "air-quality" environment available, then we'd do:</p>

        <pre>
conda activate air-quality
conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel
ipython kernel install --user --name=air-quality
        </pre>

        <p>This makes "air-quality" our activate environment (meaning packages are installed to it instead of the base environment), installs the
        "ipykernel" package (still from the "conda-forge" channel), and then makes this kernel available to Jupyter, also under the name "air-quality".
        Now, the argument to <code>--name</code> in that last line; if we'd made it "bob" then Jupyter would know the "air-quality" environment 
        by the name "bob", but trust me that gets confusing. It's better to name the kernel (what Jupyter sees) and the environment (what conda sees)
        the same.</p>

        <p>You may have noticed I left the conda environment active (I didn't do <code>conda deactivate</code> at the end of the above example). 
        I'm assuming you'll want to install some additional packages like numpy, matplotlib, and pandas. Any time you want to install packages 
        for this kernel, you <i>must</i> have the corresponding environment active, otherwise the packages are installed somewhere else.</p>

        <h5>Advantages</h5>

        <p>So why do I mess around with this whole process, instead of using the default Python 3 kernel? Well, say you want to install 
        <code>geopandas</code>, but it's not compatible with the version of <code>pandas</code> installed in your default kernel. 
        What do you do? Do you upgrade <code>pandas</code> and risk breaking every other project that relies on that default kernel? 
        Do you fuss around trying to find a version of <code>geopandas</code> that is compatible with your current <code>pandas</code>? 
        Or do you say "Eh, not worth it," and find a way to avoid using <code>geopandas</code>. With environments and separate kernels,
        that's no longer a problem - or at least much less of one.</p>
