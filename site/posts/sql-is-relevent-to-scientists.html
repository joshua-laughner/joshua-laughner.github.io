  <!-- bootstrap works by allowing you to define different behaviors for
       different size screens. Classes with the -xs, -sm, -md, or -lg extensions
       are defined to behave differently on different size screens. Here, the
       navbar-expand-md tag means that on medium size screens, the nav bar will
       have all the buttons visible, but on small and extra-small screens (mainly)
       phones and tablets) will require a button press to bring up the nav bar buttons -->

        <p>I'd heard about databases for a long time, but for scientific programming,
        I always thought, "What's the advantage over a nice, simple text file?" The way
        I saw it:</p>

        <ul>
          <li> I already knew how to work with text files my my programming languages of choice</li>
          <li> Text files are easy to view and edit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On the other hand, databases seemed like a pain in the neck:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A lot of them need a server program set up to let you access the database.</li>
          <li>I'd have to learn at least enough SQL to interact with the database (and coming from a
            Matlab/Python background, SQL takes some getting used to)</li>
          <li>A database just consists of tables, and I can make a table just fine in a text
          file as a .csv.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It took literally until the last month of my Ph.D., and getting to talk with a web developer
        who really understood the benefits of databases, before I ended up taking the plunge, figuring out
        how to work with them, and learning what makes a database better, in some cases, than a simple text
        file. Those advantages are:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>You don't need a server if you use SQLite3, which is a database management system that just saves
            your database as a single file. No messing around to set up a server.</li>
          <li>It's easy to change a line in the middle of a database. It's hard (or at least annoying) to change
          one in the middle of a text file.</li>
          <li>A database can store different data types - no need to convert to and from strings.</li>
          <li>A database intrinsically protects you from some mistakes, and lets you protect yourself from others, for example</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li> Every column has a value, even if that value is null. No worrying about your CSV writer skipping a column.</li>
              <li> You can put some simple rules on columns, like the value cannot be null, or every value must be unique, that
                can help catch some mistakes in data entry.</li>
            </ol>
          <li>A database has mechanisms in place to deal with simultaneous edits</li>
        </ol>
