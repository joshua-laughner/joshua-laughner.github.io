        <p><strong><i>With information literally at students' finger tips, the professor's
        role must become the curator and guide to information, rather than the source</i></strong></p>

        <p>I grew up in the 1990s and early 2000s, attending elementary school and middle
          school as the internet transformed from a new innovation to a principal source
          of information. I was halfway through high school before Wikipedia had one
          million articles. I remember using Microsoft Encarta on CDs in elementary school
          and AskJeeves in middle and high school.</p>

        <p>This experience has shaped my views on teaching. Now, students rely on
        teachers and professors as repositories of information less than ever, simply
        because so much information is available online. But because so much information
        is available online, students need a guide to help them navigate it all. Therefore,
        in addition to being an expert in my fields that can transmit my own understanding
        to my students, I see my resposibilities to be:</p>

        <ol>
          <li> A <strong><i>curator</i></strong> of knowledge. As an expert in my fields,
            I can sort through the available information and direct students to resources
            I determine are accurate and provide unique perspectives on the information.
            The more perspectives and methods presentation I can bring to my students, the
            better I can help those with different styles of learning than myself.</li>

          <li>A <strong><i>guide</i></strong> through the information. A student first entering
          a new subject can't know which topics to cover first, but I, as an expert, know how
          the topics within that subject fit together, and so can direct the student through them
          in an sensible order.</li>

          <li>Finally, as an instructor, to set tasks for the students (or help them design the
          tasks themselves) that give them experience using the information they obtain from myself
          or any source, and in the process, internalize and synthesize that information.</li>
        </ol>

        These roles are not new; these are roles that teachers have carried out for centuries, if
        not millenia. Only the sources and availability of information changed. And while the ability
        of the internet to connect students with instructors around the world is truly new, I believe
        it is still crucial for students to have one instructor they can meet face-to-face, and whose
        credentials they know and can trust.
